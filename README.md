# Test-driven Web Application

Functional tests test the application from the outside, from the point of view of the user.
Unit tests test the application from the inside, from the point of view of the programmer.

Functional tests should help you build an application with the right functionality, and guarantee you never accidentally break it.
Unit tests should help you to write code thatâ€™s clean and bug free.
